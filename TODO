From the admin side:

  # Show order and dates that the queued posts will be published
  
From the cron side:

  # Automatically post to Wordpress (early in the morning)
  # Automatically tweet to twitter (around lunchtime)
  # Cull rejected records older than x date
  
Later:

  # Allow people to set-up automatic post to Instapaper

Much Later:

Re-order the queue
