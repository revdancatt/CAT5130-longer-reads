CAT5130 Longer Reads
====================

This _was_ an admin tool that polled another _sekrit_ backend tool to find the most
popular stories from the guardian. It would then rejects stories that it considered
too short, leaving just the "long good" articles.

These were then presented in an admin panel that allowed an editor (i.e. me) to
review the stories and approve ones to be published on The Long Good Read blog
(and kindle version)

The project is currently on hold.
